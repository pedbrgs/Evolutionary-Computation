### About

This repository contains the source codes of the evolutionary algorithms implemented in the "Evolutionary Computation" course (EEE882). The code was implemented in Python 3.6.8. The projects were:

* **[Project 1:](https://github.com/pedbrgs/Evolutionary-Computation/blob/master/Project%201/Report-PT.pdf)** Genetic algorithms to solve the N-Queens problem and to minimize the Rastrigin function.
* **[Project 2:](https://github.com/pedbrgs/Evolutionary-Computation/blob/master/Project%202/Report-PT.pdf)** Hyperparameter tuning of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Each project has a report in Portuguese, which aims to describe the decisions made during the implementation of the algorithms, as well as the analysis of the experiments.
